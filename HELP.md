# Editor help guide

## 1. Edit existing initiatives
You can go directly to the [Susy-Editor Map-Interface] (https://susy-partners.github.io/transformap-viewer/editable.html), or use the "Go to Map" link on top of the Editor. 

The [Susy-Editor Map-Interface] (https://susy-partners.github.io/transformap-viewer/editable.html) is similar to the SUSY-Map on your websites. The only difference is an "Edit" Link in the description for each initiative. It opens the [Editor] (https://susy-partners.github.io/transformap-editor) for this initiative.

For editing existing initiatives, the menu is the same as with adding a new one. After your edit, press save, and the edit is published. If you notice in your editing, that some information is broken, you can use the "Reset"-Button,  (e.g. by editing the address and press the "Search for coordinates - Go" Button, the original position is gone.)

## 2. Add new initiatives
Go to the Susy-Editor [Editor] (https://susy-partners.github.io/transformap-editor), type in the data as required. Visually check if the marker is set in the right place. Press the "Save" button, and your new initiative is live.
  
# How to use the editor:

### Top Menu:

- Reset: Delete your current changes and reset as before your edit.
- New: Refreshes the Editor mask, to enter a new initiative.

### Address search:

- Adress fields: Enter each segment of the address. 
*Special annotations to the address (post box, door number, floor, entrance anround the corner, ...) can often not be found by the address search. In case you have such address additions, use the "Go! button first with the core address, and then add those elements to the address.*
- Go! (Address search): Search for the address above and set a marker. 
*If there is a marker before. It is replaced by the new one. If the exact address is not available as public data, the Map in the editor centers as close as possible to the area, and a marker needs to be set manually.*

### Small Map in the Editor:
